Changelog:
V0.9.5
- DME Reader - Yes, you read that correctly!
   - To enable this feature you need to click the "DME" button in on the Audio Panel!
   - It will switch between the NAV Freq. & DME Distance (in NM) every 5 seconds
   - This is a temporary measure until we can install a proper DME system!
- Flight Model Changes
- Copilot is now *livery* based
   - Choose a livery with "w/CP" on the end
   - To convert a existing Livery, open the relevent "aircraft.cfg" and add "copilot" into the "model = " section!

I hope you enjoy!
