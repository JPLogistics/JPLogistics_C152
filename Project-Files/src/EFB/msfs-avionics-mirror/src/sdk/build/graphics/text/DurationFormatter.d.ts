/**
 * A utility class for creating duration formatters.
 *
 * Each duration formatter is a function which generates output strings from input duration values. The formatting
 * behavior of a formatter is defined by its format template.
 *
 * Format templates are strings which contain zero or more fragments enclosed by curly braces (`{}`); For a given
 * format template, an output string is generated from an input duration by replacing each fragment in the template
 * with a string generated from the input. The parts of the template string that are not contained in any fragment are
 * passed to the output unchanged. Each fragment defines how its replacement string is generated. There are two types
 * of fragments:
 * * Sign fragment. In EBNF notation, these take the form `['+'], ('-' | 'â€“')`. Each sign fragment is replaced with
 * a character representing the sign of the input. The negative sign character is defined by the last character of
 * the fragment definition. The positive sign character (`+`) is included in the replacement if and only if it
 * appears in the fragment definition.
 * * Numeric fragment. In EBNF notation, these take the form
 * `{x}, ['?'], ['.', [{x}], ['(', {x}, ')']]`
 * where `x = 'H' | 'M' | 'S' | 'h' | 'm' | 's'`. Each numeric fragment is replaced with the numeric value of the
 * duration in hours, minutes, or seconds, depending on which character is used for `x`. With uppercase letters, the
 * entire portion of the input value is used. With lowercase letters, only the portion of the input value that does not
 * divide evenly into the next smallest unit is used (for hours, which is the largest unit, there is no difference
 * between using `'H'` and `'h'`).
 *   * The number of `x` characters to the left of the decimal point (including all characters if no decimal point is
 * present) in the definition controls the number of leading zeroes with which the output will be padded.
 *   * If the optional `'?'` character is present, the output will drop all digits to the left of the decimal point if
 * all such digits are equal to 0.
 *   * The total number of `x` characters to the right of the decimal point in the definition controls the decimal
 * precision of the output. Trailing zeroes to the right of the decimal point will be added to the output to a number
 * of decimal places equal to the number of non-parenthetical `x` characters to the right of the decimal point in the
 * definition. If there are no `x` characters to the right of the decimal point in the definition, then the output will
 * have infinite decimal precision with no extraneous trailing zeroes.
 *   * Rounding behavior is always round down.
 *
 * @example <caption>Formatting to hours-minutes-seconds</caption>
 * const formatter = DurationFormatter.create('{h}:{mm}:{ss}');
 * console.log(formatter(3616000));  // 1:00:16
 * console.log(formatter(36016900)); // 10:00:16
 *
 * @example <caption>Formatting to hours-minutes-seconds with decimal precision</caption>
 * const formatter = DurationFormatter.create('{h}:{mm}:{ss.s(s)}');
 * console.log(formatter(3600000)); // 1:00:00.0
 * console.log(formatter(3600550)); // 1:00:00.55
 *
 * @example <caption>Formatting to minutes-seconds</caption>
 * const formatter = DurationFormatter.create('{MM}:{ss}');
 * console.log(formatter(600000));  // 10:00
 * console.log(formatter(4200000)); // 70:00.
 *
 * @example <caption>Formatting with signs</caption>
 * const formatter = DurationFormatter.create('{-}{h}:{mm}');
 * console.log(formatter(3600000));  // 1:00
 * console.log(formatter(-3600000)); // -1:00
 *
 * const formatterWithPositiveSign = DurationFormatter.create('{+-}{h}:{mm}');
 * console.log(formatterWithPositiveSign(3600000));  // +1:00
