## Known Issues
- Using ASOBO made "Extra" liveries creates artifacts when opening the doors.
	- This most likely wont be fixed, it's _ALOT_ of work because of how ASOBO create their liveries.
	- After hosting a poll 80% said they didn't use them at all, hence this decision!

### Broken things (As you know, this is a Work in Progress!)
- Windshield Textures
- Couple of instruments need fine tuning
- Modify Fairing textures
