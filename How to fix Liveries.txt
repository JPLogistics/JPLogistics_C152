Due to the recent change to how the aircraft presents itself, all exisiting mods will need to be slightly updated in order to work!

Follow these steps:
- Open Livery Mod Folder
- Find "ASOBO_C152"
- Rename this to "JPL_C152"
- Find a folder called "Panel" (There may not be one) - If there is, you'll need to download the "Livery Fix" from GitHub (Link below)
- Open the existing Panel.cfg files
- Open the files from "Livery Fix"
- Now, copy the sections labelled "[Vcockpit0*]" there will be 7 of them, and overwrite any existing ones in the original Panel.CFG
- Do not overwrite the "[VPainting**]" Sections, these are specific to your livery!
- Save the files
- Copy Panel.xml from the "Livery Fix" to the Livery you are updating!

If you have Python3 installed now do the following!
- Open "Livery Fix" (Download from GitHub: https://github.com/JPLogistics/JPLogistics_C152/releases)
- Copy the Build.py into the "Root" folder, where you will see "SimObjects"
- Run Build.py and it should update Layout.json & Manifest.json automatically!

If you do not then do the following
- Open Layout.json
- Search "Asobo_C152" & Replace with "JPL_C152"
- Save

Now test in MSFS!

Any issues, you know where to find me!
